### 1 - Introduction 

Customer churn refers to the situation where customers or subscribers cease their association with a company or service. In the telecommunications sector, where consumers have multiple options and frequently switch providers, the annual churn rate typically ranges from 15% to 25% due to intense competition.

Tailoring customer retention strategies on an individual basis is challenging for most companies, primarily because they have a substantial customer base and cannot allocate significant resources to each one. The associated costs would outweigh any potential additional revenue. However, if a company could predict which customers are likely to leave in advance, it could concentrate its customer retention efforts on these "high-risk" clients. The ultimate objective is to expand market reach and solidify customer loyalty, with the key to success in this market centering on the customer themselves.

Customer churn is an essential metric because retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
