# Churn-Prediction-SageMaker

## 1 - Introduction 

Customer churn refers to the situation where customers or subscribers cease their association with a company or service. In the telecommunications sector, where consumers have multiple options and frequently switch providers, the annual churn rate typically ranges from 15% to 25% due to intense competition.

Tailoring customer retention strategies on an individual basis is challenging for most companies, primarily because they have a substantial customer base and cannot allocate significant resources to each one. The associated costs would outweigh any potential additional revenue. However, if a company could predict which customers are likely to leave in advance, it could concentrate its customer retention efforts on these "high-risk" clients. The ultimate objective is to expand market reach and solidify customer loyalty, with the key to success in this market centering on the customer themselves.

Customer churn is an essential metric because retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.


### In order to reudce customer churn, telecommunications companies must be able to anticipate which customers are most likely to leave.

To proactively identify early warning signs of potential churn, it's essential to establish a comprehensive understanding of customers and their interactions across various touchpoints, including physical store visits, purchase histories, customer service inquiries, online transactions, and social media engagement, among others.

By effectively addressing churn, these businesses not only safeguard their market position but also have the potential to expand and thrive. As their customer base grows, the initial acquisition costs decrease, and profits increase. Consequently, the company's primary focus for achieving success lies in reducing customer attrition and implementing robust retention strategies.

## 2 - About the Project
This is a comprehensive data science project where I leveraged AWS SageMaker for model training. This notebook will encompass the entire process, spanning from data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing to model training and deployment. Throughout this journey, I utilized the robust suite of tools and services offered by Amazon Web Services.
